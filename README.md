## 1. What is Basic_entropy_calculator?
In conjunction with the immunity debugger, you can calculate the entropy value of the binary during execution and visualize it as a graph.  
Currently, memory addresses are hard-coded and unstable, so we will apply PE header information-based address range recognition and operation stabilization codes later.
