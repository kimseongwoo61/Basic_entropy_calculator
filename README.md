# Basic_entropy_calculator - malware packing analysis tool
version : 0.1.0  

- immunity&Entropy  
In conjunction with the immunity debugger, you can calculate the entropy value of the binary during execution and visualize it as a graph.  
Currently, memory addresses are hard-coded and unstable, so we will apply PE header information-based address range recognition and operation stabilization codes later.  

- cal_entropy.py  
If you enter a file path, it is a code that measures the frequency value of the binary and calculates entropy based on it.  

to be updated!!!
